Some people are careless  enough to leave URLs without obfuscation. Besides that, make use of  references between objects; if you have one with JS on it, check if it  refers to other objects, even if they are streams. Dump suspicious stuff  with -f and -d to look for obfuscation. Sometimes you'll find ole  documents hidden inside pdfs this way.",
